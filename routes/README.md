# Routes

This folder contains the routing logic for the application. Each route defines how incoming HTTP requests are handled and which controller and method should process the request.

### Example Usage:
- **Static Routes**: Map URLs directly to specific controllers and methods.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Handle dynamic URLs with parameters (e.g., `/cocktails/view/1`).

If not using a formal routing system, you can manually handle the routing in the `index.php` file and use this folder to manage routing logic or helper files.
