# Helpers

This folder contains utility functions and classes that assist in various parts of the application. Helpers are designed to be reusable across different components, improving code efficiency and maintainability.

## Files:

- **constants.php**: Defines global constants used throughout the application. These constants may include application settings, URLs, file paths, or other static values that are used frequently across different parts of the system.

Helpers like this file reduce redundancy and provide a centralized place to manage global settings.
