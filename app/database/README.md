# Database

This folder contains SQL files that define the structure and functionality of the application's database. These files are used to set up the database schema, populate initial data, and manage database triggers.

## Folders and Files:

### **/sql**
- **schema.sql**: Defines the initial database schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints. This file is used to create the database structure.
  
- **triggers.sql**: Contains the SQL scripts for database triggers. For example, triggers that award badges to users based on specific actions or thresholds.

- **seed_data.sql**: SQL script used to populate the database with initial test data, such as users, cocktails, and badges. This is useful for development and testing purposes.

These files ensure that all developers can create and set up the same database structure and initial data locally for consistency in development.
