# Public

This folder contains all publicly accessible files such as the main `index.php` file, as well as static assets like **CSS**, **JavaScript**, The content in this folder is what the web server exposes to the outside world.

### Example Usage:
- **index.php**: The entry point for the application, usually routing requests to the appropriate controllers.
- **CSS/JS/Images**: Store frontend resources for styling and interactivity.

This folder should only contain files meant to be publicly accessible. 
Sensitive files like configuration and security logic should never be placed here.
